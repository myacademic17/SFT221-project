/**
 * Function: findValidTruckPaths
 * - Populates the "routes" array with routes that reach the given shipment destination.
 * @param shipment - Shipment struct containing the destination coordinates (row and column) of the shipment.
 * @param truck - Truck struct containing the route the truck travels on the map.
 * @param map - Map struct containing all the points (squares) in the map.
 * @param routes - Array of pointers to Route structs to store the valid routes.
 * @param size - Pointer to an integer to store the number of valid routes.
 * @returns - void, populates the "routes" array and updates the "size" variable.

/**
 * Function: getBestRoute
 * - Finds the index of the route with the shortest distance among the valid routes in the "routes" array.
 * @param routes - Array of Route structs containing all the valid routes.
 * @param shipment - Shipment struct containing the destination coordinates (row and column) of the shipment.
 * @param size - Number of valid routes in the "routes" array.
 * @returns - int, the index of the route in the "routes" array with the shortest distance. Returns -1 if no valid route is found.

 * @param shipment - Shipment struct containing the destination coordinates (row and column) of the shipment.
 * @returns - void, does not return a value, only prints to the console.

// This function checks whether a truck is overloaded after adding a shipment to it.
// It takes two parameters, 'truck', which represents the truck with its weight capacity,
// and 'ship', which represents the shipment with its weight.
// If the truck's weight capacity is less than or equal to 1000, it adds the weight of the shipment to the truck's capacity
// and then checks if the updated capacity is still less than or equal to 1000.
// If it is, the function returns 1 (true), indicating that the truck is not overloaded.
// Otherwise, it returns 0 (false), indicating that the truck is overloaded.

// It takes two parameters, 'truck', which represents the truck with its volume capacity,
// and 'boxSize', which represents the size of the box to be added.
// If the truck's volume capacity is less than or equal to 36, it adds the size of the box to the truck's capacity
// and then checks if the updated capacity is still less than or equal to 36.
// If it is, the function returns 1 (true), indicating that the box can be added without exceeding the truck's volume capacity.
// Otherwise, it returns 0 (false), indicating that the box size exceeds the truck's capacity.

// It then compares the given 'boxsize' with these constants.
// If 'boxsize' matches any of the valid sizes, the function prints "valid" and returns 1 (true), indicating that the box size is valid.
// Otherwise, it prints "invalid" and returns 0 (false), indicating that the box size is not valid.
